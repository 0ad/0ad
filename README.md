0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy game of ancient warfare. As the leader of an ancient civilization, 
you must gather the resources you need to raise a military force and dominate your enemies.
Ultimately, you will send off your army to battle in an attempt to destroy all your enemies’ structures 
that can generate units, and all units that can construct buildings. The first player that achieves this goal wins.

This is currently an incomplete, under-development version of the game.
We're always interested in getting more people involved, to help bring the game
towards completion and to share the interesting experience of developing a
project of this scope.
