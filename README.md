0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy game of ancient warfare. As the leader of an ancient civilization, 
you must gather the resources you need to raise a military force and dominate your enemies.
Ultimately, you will send off your army to battle in an attempt to destroy all your enemiesâ€™ structures 
that can generate units, and all units that can construct buildings. The first player that achieves this goal wins.

This is currently an incomplete, under-development version of the game.
We're always interested in getting more people involved, to help bring the game
towards completion and to share the interesting experience of developing a
project of this scope.
