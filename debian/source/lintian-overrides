## Currently unused overrides/comments:
# These files actually are non-minified source code. Silly lintian assumes
# that all javascript files with lines that have more than 512 characters must
# be minified javascript files, which is a faulty assumption here.
#
# This is where the lintian source-is-missing tag suggests putting non-minified
# files in, in place of files in the source tarball that only have minified
# versions. I know for a fact that none of the javascript files in this
# directory are minified (lintian is just being stupid here...).
