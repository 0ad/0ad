      0 A.D. is a real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare.
      It's a historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive
      or rewrite the history of twelve ancient civilizations, each depicted at
      their peak of economic growth and military prowess.

      The twelve factions are: Three of the Hellenic States (Athens, Sparta and
      Macedonia), two of the kingdoms of Alexander the Great's successors
      (Seleucids and Ptolemaic Egyptians), two Celtic tribes (Britons and
      Gauls), the Romans, the Persians, the Iberians, the Carthaginians, and the
      Mauryans.
      Each civilization is complete with substantially unique artwork,
      technologies and civilization bonuses.
