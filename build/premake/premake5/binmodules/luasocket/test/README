This provides the  automated test scripts used to make  sure the library
is working properly.

The files provided are:

    testsrvr.lua            -- test server
    testclnt.lua            -- test client

To run these tests, just run lua on the server and then on the client. 

    hello.lua               -- run to verify if installation worked

Good luck,
Diego.
