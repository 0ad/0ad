Stretching inland from the Aegean coastal plain, the Central Anatolian plateau occupies the area between the two zones of the folded coastal ranges in the north and south, extending east to the point where the two ranges converge. Anatolia was home to some of world's oldest civilizations like Hattians, Luwians and Hittites.",
