		"Description" : "Players start in a tough map to play with scarce wood and dangerous polar animals\n\nEarth's polar regions are the areas of the globe surrounding the poles also known as frigid zones.The Arctic's climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow. The Arctic's annual precipitation is low, with most of the area receiving less than 50 centimeters. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Except for those areas adjacent to warm ocean currents, there is almost always continuous permafrost due to the very cold winters. The famous aurora can be seen from these regions.",
