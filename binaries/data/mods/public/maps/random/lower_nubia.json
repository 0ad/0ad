		"Description" : "Known in the Greco-Roman world as the Triakontaschoinos, Lower Nubia was the area between the first and second cataracts of Nile and formed the traditional border region between Kush and Egypt. The scorching desert, steep valleys and towering cliffs of the area make this an inhospitable place to live, but the control of this ancient corridor was vital for any power seeking to control the lucrative trade routes on the Nile and affords access to the rich goldfields of the Nubian desert.",
