		"Description" : "A grey dead land where players start around a smoking volcano.\n\n\nA volcano is an opening, or rupture, in a planet's surface or crust, which allows hot magma, volcanic ash and gases to escape from below the surface. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere. Historically, so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines. Perhaps the most famous volcano of the ancient times was the Mount Vesuvius which erupted in 79 AD, which oblitirated the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",
