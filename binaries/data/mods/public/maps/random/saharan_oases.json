		"Description" : "Each players starts near an Oasis in a large, open desert\n\n\nThe Sahara is the world's largest hot desert and second largest desert, after Antarctica. At over 9,400,000 square kilometres 3,600,000 sq mi, it covers most of Northern Africa, making it almost as large as China or the United States. The Sahara stretches from the Red Sea, including parts of the Mediterranean coasts, to the outskirts of the Atlantic Ocean. To the south, it is delimited by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna that composes the northern region of central and western Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the rivers and streams in the Sahara are seasonal or intermittent, the chief exception being the Nile River, which crosses the desert from its origins in central Africa to empty into the Mediterranean. Underground aquifers sometimes reach the surface, forming oases, including the Bahariya, Ghardaia, Timimoun, Kufra, and Siwa.",
