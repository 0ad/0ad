		"Description" : "The Mediterranean, home to the Phoenicians, Greeks, Egyptians and later on Romans. They took the rudimentary knowledge and principles of organisation from Mesopotamia and forged it into something more, thereby shifting the centre of learning and knowledge to the Mediterranean Coast, thus laying the foundations of civilization as we know it today. The Mediterranean Sea is almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Gallia Transalpina (Transalpine Gaul), Italia, Greece (Graecia) and Anatolia, on the east by Syria, on the south by Libya and Mauritania, and on the west by Iberia. The name Mediterranean is derived from Latin, but the Romans themselves preferred the term 'Mare Internum' or even 'Mare Nostrum'.",
