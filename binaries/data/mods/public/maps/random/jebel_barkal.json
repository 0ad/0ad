		"Description" : "Starting near the fertile banks of the Nile, the players besiege the heavily defended city Napata which lies at the foot of the hill Jebel Barkal, the \"Pure Mountain\". It is the Southern home of Amun, and according to Kushites and Egyptians alike, the birthplace of man. Known as the Throne of the Two Lands, the ancient religious capital of Napata lay in its shadow. This is where Kings were made... and unmade! Abutting a rich floodplain downstream from the 4th cataract, this area became the breadbasket of ancient Kush.",
