The region consisted of the lands south of the Caspian sea and north of the Alborz mountains. Moisture from the Caspian sea is trapped by the high mountains and returns to the land as rain, creating a strip of lush forests and grasslands unqiue to the whole region. It was considered one of the most important satrapies of the Achaemenid, Selucid, Parthian and Sassanid empires both for its great food production and its supply of heavy infantry.",
