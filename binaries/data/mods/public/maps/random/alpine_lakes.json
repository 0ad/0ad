		"Description" : "High mountains bordering deep valleys strung with mountain streams and broader finger-like lakes.\n\n\nThe Alps is a great mountain range located in the north of the Italian Peninsula. Little is known of the early dwellers of the Alps, save from scanty accounts preserved by Roman and Greek historians and geographers. A few details have come down to us of the conquest of many of the Alpine tribes by Augustus. During the Second Punic War in 218 BC, the Carthaginian general Hannibal successfully crossed the Alps along with an army numbering 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants. This was one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare.",
