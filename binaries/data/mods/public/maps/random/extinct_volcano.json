Following years of empty, scorched deadness, signs of life started reappearing and spreading. Now the land is half-way to the full lushness of its former era. Alas, it is not to be: following a long stretch of drought, interminable rains have set in in the higher regions to the north. Water levels are rising at drastic levels, slowly forcing players to seek the high ground of the lesser, extinct volcanoes or the now again dormant great cone.",
