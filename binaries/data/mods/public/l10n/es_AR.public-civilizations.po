"Kunobelinos (perhaps better known by the latinized form of Cunobelin) was a "
"powerful ruler of the Catuvellauni. He was referred to by Romans as the King"
" of the Britons. His domains extended around the city of Kamulodunon (known "
"as Camulodunum), modern day Colchester. The Roman defeat in the battle of "
"Teutoburg Forest (Germania) allowed Kunobelinos to conquer a neighboring "
"tribe, the Trinovantes, who were Roman allies and couldn't receive Roman "
"aide. Kunobelinos seems to have been indifferent to the Romans. He traded "
"with them freely, but had few qualms subjugating known Roman allies, and "
"even sent his youngest son Adminius as a fosterling to be educated in Roman "
"Gaul. This accounted for Adminius's friendships among the Romans. Adminius "
"was given lordship over the Cantaci, who inhabited Kent, by his father. This"
" area was the prime area of Roman influence and trade in Britain, and "
"Kunobelinos shrewdly observed his youngest son's friendship with powerful "
"Roman and Gallo-Roman politicians and traders would be of use administrating"
" the region. His other sons though had no love for the Romans. When "
"Kunobelinos died of disease, he was replaced by his son Togdumnos, who "
"arrested, executed, or expelled numerous Roman sympathizers. These included "
"his own brother Adminius, and the deposed Atrebates king, Verica, who "
"appealed to their connections in the Roman Empire for aide in recovering "
"their lands. Togdumnos died in battle with the Romans, and was subsequently "
"replaced by his brother, Karatakos. It is an irony that it was his third son"
" that initially invited this Roman reprisal. Kunobelinos in his own time "
"though was possibly one of the greatest of all British kings. He conquered "
"the great majority of the southern half of Britain (his coins were being "
"minted as far as the borders of what would become Wales). He started ruling "
"over only four minor tribes in a confederation, the Catuvellauni, and ended "
"up achieving recognition as king of Britain. This recognition was so great "
"that tribes in Cambria even came to assist his sons against the Romans and "
"their British allies, and Kunobelinos was held up by the post-Roman Britons "
"as one of their great heroes; a conqueror and uniter of petty kingdoms, "
"something the post-Roman Britons or Romano-British sorely needed."
msgstr "Kunobelinos, más conocido por la forma latinizada Cunobelino, era un poderoso gobernante del territorio que ocupa la actual Colchester. Era un rey guerrero que desde Kamulodunon (o Camulodunum) conquistó a los Trinovantes, una tribu vecina, por lo cual los romanos lo llamaron el rey de los Bretones. A pesar de ser aliados de los romanos, los Trinovantes no pudieron pedir ayuda de los romanos porque fueron conquistados muy poco después del desastre romano en Germania. Kunobelinos murió por una enfermedad poco después de haber subyugado a la mitad sur de Bretaña (se acuñaron sus monedas hasta lo que hoy es Gales). Cuando murió, su hijo Togodumo lo reemplazó pero murió en batalla contra los romanos, y luego fue reemplazado por su hermano Karatakos. Es irónico que fuera su tercer hijo quien iniciara la represalia contra los romanos. Kunobelinos parece haber sido indiferente a los romanos. Comerciaba libremente con ellos, pero tenía pocos escrúpulos para subyugar aliados romanos. Incluso envió a Adminius a la Galia Romana para que fuera educado, lo que dió cuenta de la amistad de Adminius con los romanos. Su padre le otorgó el señorío de los Cantiaci, que habitaban en Kent, el área con mayor influencia romana y flujo comercial en Bretaña, y observó hábilmente que la amistad que trababa su hijo menor con los poderosos políticos y comerciantes romanos y galo-romanos le serviría para administrar la región. Sin embargo, sus otros hijos no tenían cariño por los romanos, y cuando Kunobelinos murió, Togodumo, ahora rey, arrestó, ejecutó y expulsó a numerosos simpatizantes de los romanos, incluyendo a su propio hermano Adminius y al depuesto rey de Atrevates, Verica, quien recurrió a sus conexiones con el Imperio Romano para recuperar sus tierras. Puede que Kunobelinos haya sido uno de los más grandes reyes británicos de su tiempo. Pasó de gobernar sólo cuatro tribus pequeñas en una confederación, los Catuvellauni, a conquistar grandes porciones de tierra y ser reconocido como rey de Bretaña. Tan grande fue el reconocimiento que incluso las tribus de Cambria ayudaron a sus hijos contra los romanos y sus aliados Bretones, y los Bretones posromanos consideraron a Kunobelinos como uno de sus grandes héroes: un conquistador o unificador de reinos insignificantes, algo que los Bretones posromanos necesitaban con urgencia."

"had actually at first been a Roman ally, along with her husband, Prasutagus,"
" king of the Iceni. Prasutagus had been a close Roman ally after a brief "
"uprising, respected as being forethinking even by his former enemies, now "

"until they were adults, and the Emperor of Rome would have overlordship, "
"collecting taxes and being allowed to request military aide. Much the same "

msgstr "Amiano Marcelino describió lo difícil que sería para una banda de extranjeros hacer frente a un celta si este llamaba a su esposa. Pues son tan fuertes como ellos y pueden llover golpes y patadas a los asaltantes de igual fuerza a los disparos de una catapulta. De Boudicca, reina de Iceni, se decía que era \"muy alta y terrorífica en su apariencia, su voz era muy dura y una gran masa de pelo rojo caía sobre sus hombros.\" Vestía una túnica de muchos colores sobre los que una capa se sujetaba con un broche. Boudicca en un principio fue una aliada romana, junto con su marido, Prasutagus, rey de los Iceni. Prasutagus había sido un aliado romano antes de la opresión, respetado como rey incluso por sus antiguos enemigos, ahora aliados de los romanos, y libre para gobernar su reino como su tradición dicta, excepto en un caso. Prasutagus, dándose cuenta que iba a morir, acordó una voluntad con su esposa y sus subordinados, sus hijas heredarían el territorio físico, bajo las órdenes de Boudicca, hasta que fueran mayores, y el emperador de Roma tendría el dominio, la recaudación de impuestos y que se les pidiera ayuda militar. El problema radicaba en que los romanos no reconocían herederas, y por lo tanto su mando tras la muerte de Prasutagus, esa afirmación solo para el emperador del reino de Icenia era válida. Señalaron además que era una práctica habitual que un reino incorporado al imperio sea independiente sólo durante la vida del rey inicial, tal como había ocurrido en Galatia. El imperio anexó formalmente el reino, y comenzó la extracción de duros impuestos inmediatamente, citando que Prasutagus estaba en deuda con los romanos, después de haber tomado varios préstamos que no había podido pagar. La queja de Boudicca sobre este tratamiento y el desafío a la voluntad de su difunto marido se encontraron con brutalidad, los soldados romanos las azotaron, y sus hijas, que eran solo unas niñas, fueron violadas. Boudicca y sus súbditos se enfurecieron por la desgracia sufrida por ella y sus hijas. Con el gobernador romano de Gran Bretaña ocupado con los druidas en Cambria, ahora Gales, Boudicca fue capaz de atraer a más seguidores fuera de Iceni, ya que eran casi la única tribu británica desilusionada de los romanos. Boudicca y su ejército arrasaron tres ciudades, se enfrentaron a una legión romana, y pidieron a la memoria de Arminius, un alemán que había expulsado a César cerca de un siglo antes. Boudicca fue derrotada por un gran error táctico en la batalla de Watling Street, que lleva a gran parte de su ejército al desastre, ya que no podían retirarse a un lugar seguro. Boudicca escapó, mató a sus hijas, y luego se suicidó para no caer en manos de los romanos."

"Brennus is the name which the Roman historians give to the famous leader of "

"and his brother Belinus invaded Gaul and sacked Rome in 390 B.C., 'proving' "
"that Britons had conquered Rome, the greatest civilization in the world, "
"long before Rome conquered the Britons. We know from many ancient sources "
"which predate Geoffrey that Rome was indeed sacked, but in 387 not 390, and "
"that the raid was led by a man named Brennos (which was latinized to "
"Brennus), but he and his invading horde were Gallic Senones, not British. In"
" this episode several features of Geoffrey's editing method can be seen: he "
"modified the historical Brennus/Brennos, created the brother Belinus, "
"borrowed the Gallic invasion, but omitted the parts where the Celts seemed "
"weak or foolish. His technique is both additive and subtractive. Like the "

"fabrication; it is a creative rearrangement of the available facts, with "
"details added as necessary. By virtue of their historical association, Beli "
