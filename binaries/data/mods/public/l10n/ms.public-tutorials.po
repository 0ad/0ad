Additionally, you can hover your mouse over any icon to show a tooltip with more details.\n"
"The top row of buttons contains portraits of units that may be trained at the building while the bottom one or two rows will have researchable technologies. Hover your mouse over the 'II' icon. The tooltip will tell us that advancing to 'Town Phase' requires both more constructed structures as well as more Food and Wood resources."
