"invasion in 43 A.D. Son of King Cunobelin of the Catuvellauni tribal "
"confederation, Karatakos fought for nine years against the Romans with "
"little success, eventually fleeing to the tribes in Wales, where he was "
"defeated decisively. Finally he entered Northern Britain, where was handed "

"Emperor Claudius and died in Italy. Tradition states he converted to "
"Christianity when his wife did, but there is nothing known of this as "
"definite. Probably more notable is the matter that he was allowed to live "

"Kunobelinos (perhaps better known by the latinized form of Cunobelin) was a "
"powerful ruler of the Catuvellauni. He was referred to by Romans as the King"
" of the Britons. His domains extended around the city of Kamulodunon (known "
"as Camulodunum), modern day Colchester. The Roman defeat in the battle of "
"Teutoburg Forest (Germania) allowed Kunobelinos to conquer a neighboring "
"tribe, the Trinovantes, who were Roman allies and couldn't receive Roman "
"aid. Kunobelinos seems to have been indifferent to the Romans. He traded "
"with them freely, but had few qualms subjugating known Roman allies, and "
"even sent his youngest son Adminius as a fosterling to be educated in Roman "
"Gaul. This accounted for Adminius's friendships among the Romans. Adminius "
"was given lordship over the Cantaci, who inhabited Kent, by his father. This"
" area was the prime area of Roman influence and trade in Britain, and "
"Kunobelinos shrewdly observed his youngest son's friendship with powerful "
"Roman and Gallo-Roman politicians and traders would be of use administrating"
" the region. His other sons though had no love for the Romans. When "
"Kunobelinos died of disease, he was replaced by his son Togdumnos, who "
"arrested, executed, or expelled numerous Roman sympathizers. These included "
"his own brother Adminius, and the deposed Atrebates king, Verica, who "
"appealed to their connections in the Roman Empire for aide in recovering "
"their lands. Togdumnos died in battle with the Romans, and was subsequently "
"replaced by his brother, Karatakos. It is an irony that it was his third son"
" that initially invited this Roman reprisal. Kunobelinos in his own time "
"though was possibly one of the greatest of all British kings. He conquered "
"the great majority of the southern half of Britain (his coins were being "
"minted as far as the borders of what would become Wales). He started ruling "
"over only four minor tribes in a confederation, the Catuvellauni, and ended "
"up achieving recognition as king of Britain. This recognition was so great "
"that tribes in Cambria even came to assist his sons against the Romans and "
"their British allies, and Kunobelinos was held up by the post-Roman Britons "
"as one of their great heroes; a conqueror and uniter of petty kingdoms, "
"something the post-Roman Britons or Romano-British sorely needed."

"Ammianus Marcellinus described how difficult it would be for a band of "
"foreigners to deal with a Celt if he called in the help of his wife. For she"
" was stronger than he was and could rain blows and kicks upon the assailants"
" equal in force to the shots of a catapult. Boudicca, queen of the Iceni, "
"was said to be 'very tall and terrifying in appearance; her voice was very "
"harsh and a great mass of red hair fell over her shoulders. She wore a tunic"
" of many colors over which a thick cloak was fastened by a brooch. Boudicca "
"had actually at first been a Roman ally, along with her husband, Prasutagus,"
" king of the Iceni. Prasutagus had been a close Roman ally after a brief "
"uprising, respected as being forethinking even by his former enemies, now "
"allied Romans, and free to rule his kingdom as their native tradition "
"dictated, except in one case. Prasutagus, realizing he was going to die, "
"agreed upon a will with his wife and subordinates; his daughters would "
"inherit the physical running of the territory, under Boudicca's stewardship "
"until they were adults, and the Emperor of Rome would have overlordship, "
"collecting taxes and being allowed to request military aid. Much the same "
"situation as he already held. The problem lay in that the Romans did not "
"recognize female heirs, and thus asserted, upon Prasutagus's death, that "
"only the Emperor's claim to the kingdom of Icenia was valid. They further "
"noted it was regular Roman practice to only allow a client kingdom to be "
"independent for the lifetime of the initial king, such as had occurred in "
"Galatia. The Empire formally annexed the kingdom, and began extracting harsh"
" taxes immediately, citing that Prasutagus was indebted to the Romans, "
"having taken several loans during his lifetime that he had failed to repay. "
"Boudicca's complaint about this treatment and the defiance of her deceased "
"husband's will was met with brutality; Roman soldiers flogged her, and her "
"daughters, only children, were raped. Boudicca and her subjects were "
"infuriated at the disgrace done to their queen and the children. With the "
"Roman governor of Britain engaged with the druids in Cambria, now Wales, "
"Boudicca was able to attract more followers from outside the Iceni, as they "
"were hardly the only British tribe growing rapidly disillusioned with the "
"Romans. Boudicca and her army laid waste to three cities, routed a Roman "
"legion, and called on the memory of Arminius, a German who had routed the "
"Romans from his lands, and their own ancestors who had driven off Caesar "
"near a century earlier. Boudicca was defeated by a major tactical blunder in"
" the Battle of Watling Street, leading to much of her force being "
"slaughtered as they could not withdraw to safety. Boudicca herself escaped, "
"and then slew her daughters, and then herself, to avoid further shame at "
"Roman hands."

"created the brother Belinus, borrowed the Gallic invasion, but omitted the "
"parts where the Celts seemed weak or foolish. His technique is both additive"
" and subtractive. Like the tale of Trojan origin, the story of the sack of "
