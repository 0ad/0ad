"Kunobelinos, perhaps better known by the latinized form of Cunobelin, was a "
"powerful ruler centered in the territory around modern day Colchester. "
"Ruling the Catuvellauni from Kamulodunon(better known as Camulodunum), he "
"was a warrior king who conquered a neighboring tribe, the Trinovantes, and "
"was referred to by the Romans as the King of the Britons. The Trinovantes, "
"while having been Roman allies, were not able to call for Roman aide, as "
"they were conquered shortly after the Roman's own disaster in Germania. "
"Kunobelinos died of disease after subjugating the great majority of the "
"southern half of Britain (his coins were being minted as far as the borders "
"of what would become Wales). When he died, his son Togdumnos replaced him, "
"who died in battle with the Romans, and was subsequently replaced by his "
"brother, Karatakos. It is an irony that it was his third son that initially "
"invited this Roman reprisal. Kunobelinos seems to have been indifferent to "
"the Romans. He traded with them freely, but had few qualms subjugating known"
" Roman allies, and even sent Adminius as a fosterling to be educated in "
"Roman Gaul. This accounted for Adminius's friendships among the Romans, and "
"he was given lordship over the Cantaci, who inhabited Kent, by his father. "
"This area was the prime area of Roman influence and trade in Britain, and he"
" shrewdly observed his youngest son's friendship with powerful Roman and "
"Gallo-Roman politicians and traders would be of use administrating the "
"region. His other sons though had no love for the Romans, and when "
"Kunobelinos died, Togdumnos, now king, arrested, executed, or expelled "
"numerous Roman sympathizers, including his own brother Adminius, and the "
"deposed Atrebates king, Verica, who appealed to their connections in the "
"Roman Empire for aide in recovering their lands. Kunobelinos in his own time"
" though was possibly one of the greatest of all British kings. He conquered "
"huge portions of land from originally ruling over only four minor tribes in "
"a confederation, the Catuvellauni, and achieved recognition as king of "
"Britain. This recognition was so great that tribes in Cambria even came to "
"assist his sons against the Romans and their British allies, and Kunobelinos"
" was held up by the post-Roman Britons as one of their great heroes; a "
"conqueror and uniter of petty kingdoms, something the post-Roman Britons or "
"Romano-British sorely needed."

"Ammianus Marcellinus described how difficult it would be for a band of "
"foreigners to deal with a Celt if he called in the help of his wife. For she"
" was stronger than he was and could rain blows and kicks upon the assailants"
" equal in force to the shots of a catapult. Boudicca, queen of the Iceni, "
"was said to be 'very tall and terrifying in appearance; her voice was very "
"harsh and a great mass of red hair fell over her shoulders. She wore a tunic"
" of many colors over which a thick cloak was fastened by a brooch. Boudicca "
"had actually at first been a Roman ally, along with her husband, Prasutagus,"
" king of the Iceni. Prasutagus had been a close Roman ally after a brief "
"uprising, respected as being forethinking even by his former enemies, now "
"allied Romans, and free to rule his kingdom as their native tradition "
"dictated, except in one case. Prasutagus, realizing he was going to die, "
"agreed upon a will with his wife and subordinates; his daughters would "
"inherit the physical running of the territory, under Boudicca's stewardship "
"until they were adults, and the Emperor of Rome would have overlordship, "
"collecting taxes and being allowed to request military aide. Much the same "
"situation as he already held. The problem lay in that the Romans did not "
"recognize female heirs, and thus asserted, upon Prasutagus's death, that "
"only the Emperor's claim to the kingdom of Icenia was valid. They further "
"noted it was regular Roman practice to only allow a client kingdom to be "
"independent for the lifetime of the initial king, such as had occurred in "
"Galatia. The Empire formally annexed the kingdom, and began extracting harsh"
" taxes immediately, citing that Prasutagus was indebted to the Romans, "
"having taken several loans during his lifetime that he had failed to repay. "
"Boudicca's complaint about this treatment and the defiance of her deceased "
"husband's will was met with brutality; Roman soldiers flogged her, and her "
"daughters, only children, were raped. Boudicca and her subjects were "
"infuriated at the disgrace done to their queen and the children. With the "
"Roman governor of Britain engaged with the druids in Cambria, now Wales, "
"Boudicca was able to attract more followers from outside the Iceni, as they "
"were hardly the only British tribe growing rapidly disillusioned with the "
"Romans. Boudicca and her army laid waste to three cities, routed a Roman "
"legion, and called on the memory of Arminius, a German who had routed the "
"Romans from his lands, and their own ancestors who had driven off Caesar "
"near a century earlier. Boudicca was defeated by a major tactical blunder in"
" the Battle of Watling Street, leading to much of her force being "
"slaughtered as they could not withdraw to safety. Boudicca herself escaped, "
"and then slew her daughters, and then herself, to avoid further shame at "
"Roman hands."

"Brennus is the name which the Roman historians give to the famous leader of "

"Monmouth, the cleric who wrote “History of the Kings of Britain”, Brennus "
"and his brother Belinus invaded Gaul and sacked Rome in 390 B.C., 'proving' "
"that Britons had conquered Rome, the greatest civilization in the world, "
"long before Rome conquered the Britons. We know from many ancient sources "
"which predate Geoffrey that Rome was indeed sacked, but in 387 not 390, and "
"that the raid was led by a man named Brennos (which was latinized to "
"Brennus), but he and his invading horde were Gallic Senones, not British. In"
" this episode several features of Geoffrey's editing method can be seen: he "
"modified the historical Brennus/Brennos, created the brother Belinus, "
"borrowed the Gallic invasion, but omitted the parts where the Celts seemed "
"weak or foolish. His technique is both additive and subtractive. Like the "
"tale of Trojan origin, the story of the sack of Rome is not pure "
"fabrication; it is a creative rearrangement of the available facts, with "
"details added as necessary. By virtue of their historical association, Beli "
"and Bran are often muddled with the earlier brothers Belinus and Brennus "
