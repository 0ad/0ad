As a free, open source game, we don't have the resources to test on a wide range of systems, but we want to provide the best quality experience to as many players as possible. When you enable automatic feedback, we'll receive data to help us understand the hardware we should focus on supporting, and to identify performance problems we should fix.

The following data will be sent to our server:

• A random user ID (stored in %APPDATA%\0ad\config\user.cfg on Windows, $HOME/.config/0ad/config/user.cfg on Unix), to let us detect repeated reports from the same user.
• Game version number and basic build settings (optimisation mode, CPU architecture, timestamp, compiler version).
• Hardware details: OS version, graphics driver version, OpenGL capabilities, screen size, CPU details, RAM size.
• Performance details: a snapshot of timing data a few seconds after you start a match or change graphics settings.

The data will only be a few kilobytes each time you run the game, so bandwidth usage is minimal.

We will store the submitted data on our server, and may publish statistics or non-user-identifiable details to help other game developers with similar questions. We will store the IP address that submitted the data, to help detect abuse of the service, but will not publish it. The published data can be seen at http://feedback.wildfiregames.com/
