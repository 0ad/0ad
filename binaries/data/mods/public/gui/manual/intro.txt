[font="sans-bold-18"]0 A.D. in-game manual
[font="sans-14"]
Thank you for installing 0 A.D.! This page will give a brief overview of the features available in this incomplete, under-development, alpha version of the game.

[font="sans-bold-16"]Graphics settings
[font="sans-14"]You can switch between fullscreen and windowed mode by pressing Alt + Enter. In windowed mode, you can resize the window. If the game runs too slowly, you can change some settings in the options window: try disabling the "HQ Water Effects" and "Shadows" options.

[font="sans-bold-16"]Playing the game
[font="sans-14"]The controls and gameplay should be familiar to players of traditional RTS games. There are currently a lot of missing features and poorly-balanced stats – you will probably have to wait until a beta release for it to work well.

Basic controls:
• Left-click to select units.
• Left-click-and-drag to select groups of units.
• Right-click to order units to the target.
• Arrow keys or WASD keys to move the camera.
• Ctrl + arrow keys, or shift + mouse wheel, to rotate the camera.
• Mouse wheel, or "+" and "-" keys, to zoom.

[font="sans-bold-16"]Modes
[font="sans-14"]The main menu gives access to two game modes:

• [font="sans-bold-14"]Single-player[font="sans-14"] — play a sandbox game or against one or more AI opponents. The AI/AIs are under development and may not always be up to date on the new features, but you can test playing the game against an actual opponent if you aren't able to play with a human.

• [font="sans-bold-14"]Multiplayer[font="sans-14"] — play against human opponents over the internet.

To set up a multiplayer game, one player must select the "Host game" option. The game uses UDP port 20595, so the host must configure their NAT/firewall/etc to allow this. Other players can then select "Join game" and enter the host's IP address.

[font="sans-bold-16"]Game setup
[font="sans-14"]In a multiplayer game, only the host can alter the game setup options.

First, select what type of map you want to play:
• [font="sans-bold-14"]Random map[font="sans-14"] — A map created automatically from a script
• [font="sans-bold-14"]Scenario map[font="sans-14"] — A map created by map designers and with fixed civilisations
• [font="sans-bold-14"]Skirmish map[font="sans-14"] — A map created by map designers but where the civilisations can be chosen

Then the maps can be further filtered. The default maps are generally playable maps. Naval maps are maps where not all opponents can be reached over land and demo maps are maps used for testing purposes (generally not useful to play on). The "All Maps" filter shows all maps together in one list.

Finally change the settings. For random maps this includes the number of players, the size of a map, etc. For scenarios you can only select who controls which player (decides where you start on the map etc). The options are either a human player, an AI or no player at all (the opponent will just be idle).

When you are ready to start, click the "Start game" button.
