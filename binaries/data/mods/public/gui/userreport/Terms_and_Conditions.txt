[font="sans-bold-18"]0 A.D. Empires Ascendant UserReporter Terms and Conditions[/font]

[font="sans-bold-14"]Document Date:[/font] 2018-10-13

The 0 A.D. UserReporter is a tool that allows you, the 0 A.D. player, to automatically upload hardware- and software-system details in order to help Wildfire Games and community developers to improve the performance and compatibility of 0 A.D.

[font="sans-bold-14"]Purpose of the UserReport:[/font]
The UserReports indicate which system features (for example CPU instruction sets and OpenGL capabilities) are widely supported by the computer systems of 0 A.D. players.
This allows developers to decide which 0 A.D. program code is safe to use and which optimizations are most feasible to implement next.
If the UserReporter is enabled, the UserReport containing that information is uploaded to Wildfire Games once per program launch (GDPR 13.1.c, GDPR 15.1.a).

[font="sans-bold-14"]UserReport data:[/font]
 1. Hardware Details, for example the screen size, CPU clock rate, memory capacity and the sound card manufacturer.
 2. System Software Details, for example the operating system version, graphics driver version, OpenGL capabilities.
 3. Application Details, for example the 0 A.D. version and build number.
 4. The UserID. This is a pseudonym generated by the UserReporter the first time it is used (GDPR 4.5, GDPR 25.1, GDPR 32.1.a).
    The UserID enables developers to count how many 0 A.D. players use a specific set of hardware or system software without allowing them to attribute the data to any person.
 5. The date of the upload of the UserReport. This allows focus on recent UserReports and disregard old reports.

The UserReport does not include any specially protected categories of personal data (GDPR 9, GDPR 10).
The transmission is secured with SSL. Data is protected against unintentional loss in encrypted backups for additional time (GDPR 30.1.g, GDPR 32).
