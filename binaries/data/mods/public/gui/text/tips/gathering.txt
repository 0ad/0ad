RESOURCE GATHERING
- Use citizen soldiers and female citizens to gather resources.

- Female citizens are faster gathering vegetable resources.

- Infantry citizen soldiers are faster gathering minerals.

- Cavalry citizen soldiers are faster gathering meat.

- The higher the level of a citizen soldier (advanced, elite), the better he fights, but the less efficient he is at gathering resources.
