RESOURCE GATHERING
Use citizen-soldiers and female citizens to gather resources.
Female citizens gather vegetable resources faster.
Infantry citizen-soldiers are faster gathering minerals.
Cavalry citizen-soldiers are faster gathering meat.
The higher the level of a citizen-soldier (advanced, elite), the better he fights, but the less efficient he is at gathering resources.
