CARTHAGINIAN SACRED BAND
- Champion Spearmen and Champion Cavalry Spearmen for Carthage.

- Both are trainable from the Temple, instead of the Fortress like most other champions.

- Use the Spearmen as heavy infantry against cavalry. Use the Cavalry as heavy shock against siege weapons and skirmishers.
