DEFAULT FORMATION
Right-click an icon to set the default formation: units that are ordered to walk or patrol will automatically use it.
Can be de-activated by choosing “no formation” as the default.
The “Formation control” option lets you choose whether formations disband for orders other than walking or patrolling.
