SPEARMEN
- The basic melee infantry for every faction in the game.

- Used against cavalry for a 2x attack bonus.

- Decent hack attack and a good charge bonus make them good front line troops.

- They are countered by ranged units and swordsmen, so support your spearmen with slingers or cavalry.
