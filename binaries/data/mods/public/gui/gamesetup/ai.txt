Although reasonably easy for an experienced player, the default AI level is quite challenging for new players before they master the basic mechanisms of the game. It is advised to start by playing against a lower level (sandbox or very easy) when beginning with the game. Changing the AI level is done by clicking on the gear icon next to each AI player in the player selection panel above.
