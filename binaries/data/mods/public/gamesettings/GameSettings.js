/**
 * Data store for game settings.
 *
 * This is intended as a helper to create the settings object for a game.
 * This object is referred to as:
 *  - g_InitAttributes in the GUI session context
 *  - InitAttributes in the JS simulation context
 *  - Either InitAttributes or MapSettings in the C++ simulation.
 * Settings can depend on each other, and the map provides many.
 * This class's job is thus to provide a simpler interface around that.
