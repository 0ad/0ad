Antipater, the Macedonian regent, lead an army to stop this new uprising. In the Battle of Megalopolis, the Macedonians prevailed in a long and bloody battle. Much like Leonidas 150 years earlier, instead of surrendering, Agis made a heroic final stand in order to buy time for his troops to retreat."
