    <History>Farming probably originated in the lands of Mesopotamia circa 8000 BC. The arable lands of Sumer and Akkad, well irrigated by the Tigris and Euphrates, accounted for food surpluses, which were in turn stored in granaries present in every town. The Persians, who were originally shepherds and hunters, probably began farming under the influence of the nearby Elamites.</History>
