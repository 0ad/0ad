    <History>Housing was generally built of adobe or sandstone then plastered with stucco. Flat roofs predominate, few windows, arched doorways in evidence, kind of a blend of Achaemenian and Mediterranean styles with some tiled roofs. In the biggest cities, especially Carthage and such as Utica, housing was in flat-roofed structures rising as high as 6 and 7 stories.</History>
