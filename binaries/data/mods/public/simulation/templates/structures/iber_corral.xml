    <History>A place for a farmer to pen his animals. Garrison a sheep, goat, or cow here to gain a trickle of the food resource. Garrisoning an animal here also "fattens" them so that they may be slaughtered and gathered for a quick burst of food. Horses can be captured in the wild and placed in the Corral. Unlike normal corralled animals that generate food, the corralled Horse functions similarly to a relic as in AoK.. As long as it/they remain(s) in the Corral, the resource cost of training horse-mounted units (cavalry) is reduced by a fixed amount of -5% per animal corralled.</History>
