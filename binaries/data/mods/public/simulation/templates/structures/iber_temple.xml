    <History>The Iberian tribes did not typically worship their gods at temples, but there has been a single instance in which the remains of an ancient Tartessian temple has been unearthed in Andalusia in southern Spain. The Iberians for the most part worshipped their gods at small household votive altars in their homes or sometimes at smallish monuments to them in the outdoors. Their two principal gods (though they are also known to have had many others) were Endovelico, as the male represented by a boar, and Ataecina, the female counterpart as represented by a goat.</History>
