    <History>Iberian structures of the time were typically built either entirely of stone or with stone stub walls with 'adobe' up to the roof lines above them. Roofs were then, depending on the economic status of individuals, covered with a composite of mud and binding vegetable and waterproofing asphaltic materials, or slate stone, or in many cases in the region, with so-called Spanish roofing tiles.</History>
