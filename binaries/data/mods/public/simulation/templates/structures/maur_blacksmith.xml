    <History>The Indians acquired the knowledge for making wootz (or urukke) steel from the Tamils during the 5th century BC. Since that time, swords, knives, and other implements made of this steel were highly prized in the ancient world. Such steel was the sharpest and most sought-after of its age, displaying as it does beautiful organic patterns from the alloys within the steel. The famous "Damascene" steel was derived from it, exported from India all the way to Syria. It is said that the Indian King Purushottama (Porus) of Paurava gave a sword made of wootz steel to Alexander the Great as a gift after the Battle of the Hydaspes River.</History>
