    <History>'Soro' is a Basque term for a field for the growing of food. In historical terms, the Iberians tended to growing grains and vegetables, including a variety of roots, greens and artichokes (large blue thistle-like flower-heads), grape vines, and fruit trees ranging from the olive and fig to the apple. The Iberian Peninsula was an agricultural surplus area.</History>
