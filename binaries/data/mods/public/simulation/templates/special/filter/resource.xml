  <!-- When dying, resources lose the unitMotion component, this causes them to have no clearance.
       Since unit obstructions no longer have a radius, this makes them unreachable in some cases (see #3530).
       Instead, create a static, unblocking (see #3530 for why) static obstruction.
       TODO: this should probably be generalized as a parameter on entity death or something.
