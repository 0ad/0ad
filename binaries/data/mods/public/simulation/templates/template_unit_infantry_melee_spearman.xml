    <Rollover>Probably one of the most primitive units in the game. Fighting with a sharp object at the end of the pole didn't require a lot of technology to develop. It also allowed the human to distance themselves from their attacker. As time passed the spears got longer and longer. Started with a fighting style similar to using a quarterstaff, then to using them in numbers as a 'pin cushion' vs. humans (sarissa in a phalanx). Later it was developed to combat cavalry. During the medieval period it evolved to the pike. These units tended to be armoured as heavily as possible.</Rollover>
