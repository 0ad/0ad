    <History>The Trireme was the most common warship of the Mediterranean â€“ it was used by Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans alike. The Romans were already using these vessels by the beginning of the Punic Wars, and underwent a number of modifications. These remain controversial, but it seems that Triremes remained the mainstay of the fleet for this era.</History>
