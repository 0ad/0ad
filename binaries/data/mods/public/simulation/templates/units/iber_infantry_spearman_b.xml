    <History>A long-bladed spear was a chief melee weapon of the Iberian infantry, often used after the javelins had been thrown. Typically carried by infantry known as scutarii for their long oval body shields, the spearmen would close in formation to attack their opponents. Usually lightly armored, they were quick and had a ferocious reputation.</History>
