    <History>The Anusiya (or "Attendants") were the elite of the Persian army, handsomely equipped with armor and weapons, including swords which were rare weapons in the normal ranks. A unit of 10,000 men, their number was always kept to full strength whenever a man was killed or wounded, resulting in their nickname, "The Immortals". They were ferocious fighters and well respected.</History>
