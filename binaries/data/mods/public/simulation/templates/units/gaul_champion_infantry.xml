    <History>The sword among Celts varies in reputation and commonality. Shortswords, essentially truly just long, broad-bladed daggers, were common, but cheaply made, and most likely the swords refered to as bending after a hard strike, and needing bent back into place. The iron construction of longswords, such as used here, was greatly superior, but also much more expensive. The longsword was primarily a weapon of aristocracy and experienced professional soldiers, who could either afford the weapon, have it made for them by their lord as a reward for service, passed down to them by family, or looted from the field.</History>
