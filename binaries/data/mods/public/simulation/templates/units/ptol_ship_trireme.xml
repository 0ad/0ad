    <History>The Penteres is the Greek version of the Quinquereme, "pente" being the Greek word for five and "eres" the word for rows of oars. But in this case, experimental historians have surmised that the "five" actually means five rowers for each vertical section of oars, in most cases being only two "remes" or rows of oars with three rowers on the top oars and two rowers on the bottom oars. Such an arrangement allowed oars to reach unprecedented length, which added power to each stroke of the oar. The Penteres was designed by the Syracusans in Sicily and quickly showed itself to be superior to the Trieres (Trireme) of old, both in power of its ram and its ability to garrison more marines for boarding and raiding activities. The Penteres was adopted as the "ship of the line" by the Successor kingdoms and was the workhorse of any self-respecting Greek navy for nearly three hundred years and could mount bolt-shooters and catapults upon its deck.</History>
