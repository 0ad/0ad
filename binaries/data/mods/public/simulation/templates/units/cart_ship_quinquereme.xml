    <History>The Carthaginians were long in the forefront of ship technology, maintaining the largest fleet in the Mediterranean for centuries. Their Quinquereme was also the best on the water and essentially unchallengeable until the Romans built a Quinquereme largely from Carthaginian design (having 'captured' a grounded ship of its type) then later developed the corvus boarding ramp for it.</History>
