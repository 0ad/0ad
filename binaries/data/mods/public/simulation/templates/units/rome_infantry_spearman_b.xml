    <History>The Triarii were the third line of heavy infantry in the Republican Roman army. Made up of the veterans from previous campaigns, they often possessed the most fashionable arms and armor. Armed with a spear and gladius, the Triarii usually did not fight unless the battle was going poorly or enemy forces required the use of a spear to fend them off. In many cases the Triarii were left at the camp instead of marching out with the rest of the army.</History>
