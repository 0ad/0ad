    <History> To the best of our knowledge, only one 'temple'-like structure has been found on the Iberian Peninsula dating from the times and the Iberians worshiped their pantheon of gods at small home altars; however, a very special sculptured head and torso was found in a farmer's field around the turn of the 20th century of a personage who was obviously someone of great substance. As the two principal gods, of the many worshiped, were male Endovellikos and female Ataekina, we thought it would be nice to adopt The Lady of Elche as our priestess-healer representing Ataekina. We know from archelogy and the Romans that Ataekina was associated with spring, the changing of seasons, and nature in general. Ataekina also seems to have been associated with the cycle of birth-death-rebirth.</History>
