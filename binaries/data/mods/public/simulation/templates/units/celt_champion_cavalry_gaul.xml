    <History>In Gaul we know of heavy cavalry, possibly predecessors to later knights. They used a Celtic lance overhand, a good shield, and wore good armor. Vercingetorix was famous for having a number of them, but their use long precedes him. Heavy Celtic horsemen are found in graves as early as the 600s, with scale coats. Later, with the advent of mail, their armor would largely change to this. They would be experienced, aristocratic or noblemen, or their retainers equipped in kind. Each man would probably have several personal attendants. Some would be powerful noblemen, such as chiefs and kings. In battle, they would be on par with much of the best heavy cavalry in western Europe, due to superior armor, such as mail armor with additional layers of mail over the vital organs, weapons such as high-quality iron spearheads, swords, and a thong of javelins, giving them versatility, and years of experience and training. Their historical use saw them capable of breaking even well-defended positions, or acting to great effect in flanking manuevers.</History>
