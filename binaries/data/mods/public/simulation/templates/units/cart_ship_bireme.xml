    <History>The Phoenicians/Carthaginians were the first to develop 'bireme technology' by taking the pentakonter and 'cutting it in half' then stacking two rows of oarsmen tiered atop the other, producing a ship half the length that was more maneouvreable and faster in the water. The ram section at the bow was built to look like a sea monster swimming through the water in order to terrorise superstitious potential competitors. They were also fed tall tales of such denizens in a propaganda effort to mislead and frighten off others who might consider following them into unknown waters.</History>
