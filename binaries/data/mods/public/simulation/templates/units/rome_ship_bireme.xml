    <History>By the time of the Second Punic War the Romans had adopted an improved bireme design created by the Liburnians of Illyria. Faster, lighter, and more agile then conventional warships, the Liburna (sing. Liburnus) would quickly become widespread throughout the Roman navy. They appear to have been used in support of Triremes.</History>
