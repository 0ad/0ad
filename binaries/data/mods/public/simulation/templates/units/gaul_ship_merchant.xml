    <History>These very small boats were used mainly for fishing, but they were also used to transport goods and personnel. The shell is wickerwork, covered with animal hides. Now they are exclusive to Ireland. They do not have a keel, but are able to ride large ocean waves and navigate up shallow rivers. First written account was by Julius Caesar in 100 BC. There were rumours of larger hide boats, but they were not documented with any solid proof.</History>
