    <History>When Demetrius Poliorcetes besieged Salamis, in Cyprus, he instructed that a machine be constructed, which he called "the taker of cities." Its form was that of a square tower, each side 90 cubits high and 45 wide. It rested on four wheels, each eight cubits high. It was divided into nine stories, the lower of which contained machines for throwing great stones, the middle large catapults for throwing spears, and the highest, other machines for throwing smaller stones, together with smaller catapults. It was manned with 200 soldiers, besides those that moved it by pushing the parallel beams at the bottom.</History>
