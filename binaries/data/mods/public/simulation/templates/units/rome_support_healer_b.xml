    <History>During the Republic, the position of priest was elevated and required a lot of responsibilities, which is why priests were by no means chosen randomly. The position of Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of the Roman religion, was occupied by such prominent figures as Julius Caesar, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Augustus.</History>
