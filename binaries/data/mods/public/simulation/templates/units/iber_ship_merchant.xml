    <History>The Iberians, especially along the western and northwestern coasts of the peninsula, had been trading by sea with peoples in North Africa, Western Europe along the coast of Gaul and the British Isles by boat well back into the 2nd millennium BC. As such, their ships were very seaworthy, crossing stretches of the Atlantic Ocean (while they are not known to have traded by sea in the Mediterranean). Though the Carthaginians came along around the beginning of the 1st millennium and co-opted much of that trade, along with the Greeks in the Mediterranean, with 'better ships', they still would have influenced the seafaring peoples who built the 'high sided sailing vessels' along the Atlantic Seaboard. So it is not such a stretch to specify a good strong sailing ship for Iberians that can be used as either a merchant trading vessel or a quasi-war fighting transport of units.</History>
