    <History>Unlike their rivals the Seleucids, the Ptolemies maintained a relatively small force of full-time soldiers to act as a Royal Guard around the sovereign. These were drawn from the Macedonian and Greek kleruchs, settled in Egypt by the first Ptolemy. This consisted of a lance-armed (xystophoroi) cavalry Royal Guard (possibly Hetairoi) 700 strong; and an infantry Royal Guard (Basilikon Agema) 3,000 strong. The infantry guard were phalangites, though a 1,000 man unit within the Agema may have been able to fight as more traditional hypaspists or as thorakitai (spear or spear-and-javelin armed, fast moving heavy infantry).</History>
