    <History>Indibil was king of the Ilegetes, a large federation ranged principally along the Ebro River in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. During the Barcid expansion, from 212 BCE he had initially been talked into allying himself with the Carthaginians who hade taken control of a lot of territory to the south and west, however after loss and his capture in a major battle he was convinced, some say tricked, to switch to the Roman side by Scipio Africanus. But that alliance didn't last long, as Roman promises were hollow and the Romans acted more like conquerors than allies. So, while the Romans and their allies had ended Carthaginian presence in 'Hispania' in 206 BCE, Indibil and another tribal prince by the name of Mandonio, who may have been his brother, rose up in rebellion against the Romans. They were defeated in battle, but rose up in a 2nd even larger rebellion that had unified all the Ilergetes again in 205 BCE. Outnumbered and outarmed they were again defeated, Indibil losing his life in the final battle and Mandonio being captured then later put to death. From that date onward the Ilergetes remained a pacified tribe under Roman rule.</History>
