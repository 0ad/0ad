    <SpecificName>Akontistḗs Heílōs</SpecificName>
    <History>Helots were the subject class of Spartan society and toiled tirelessly for their full-blooded Spartan masters. In times of need, Helots were pressed into service to serve as squires and battlefield skirmishers if necessary. The loyalty and performance of these troops was often suspect, but good performance on the battlefield sometimes meant freedom could be earned for the Helot warrior and his family.</History>
