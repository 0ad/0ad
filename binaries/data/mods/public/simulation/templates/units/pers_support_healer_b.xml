    <History>Under both the Medes and later the Persian the tribe of the Magi or the Magians were the masters of religious and oral tradition, comparable to the Levites of the Bible. They were connected to Zoroastrianism, but likely tended to other Iranian cults as well. Aside from religious duties the Magians also functioned as the Great King's bureaucrats and kept his administration running.</History>
