    <History>Caros was a chief of the Belli tribe located just east of the Celtiberi (Numantines at the center). Leading the confederated tribes of the meseta central (central upland plain) he concealed 20,000 foot and 5,000 mounted troops along a densely wooded track. Q. Fulvius Nobilior neglected proper reconnaissance and lead his army into the trap strung out in a long column. Some 10,000 of 15,000 Roman legionaries fell in the massive ambush that was sprung upon them. The date was 23 August of 153 BCE, the day when Rome celebrated the feast of Vulcan. By later Senatorial Decree it was ever thereafter known as dies ater, a 'sinister day', and Rome never again fought a battle on the 23rd of August. Caros was wounded in a small cavalry action the same evening and died soon thereafter, but he had carried off one of the most humiliating defeats that Rome ever suffered.</History>
