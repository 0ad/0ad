This is an AI for 0 A.D. (http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/) based on the testBot.

Install by placing the files into the data/mods/public/simulation/ai/qbot folder.

If you are developing you might find it helpful to change the debugOn line in qBot.js.  This will make it spew random warnings depending on what I have been working on.  Use the debug() function to make your own warnings.

Addendum for the experimental version: this is the regular qBot, with improvements here and there. It's "experimental" as it is currently in "test" phase, and if it proves to work and be more efficient than the normal qBot, will replace it in the next alpha. Please report any error to the wildfire games forum ( http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?act=idx ), thanks for playing the bot!
(note:debug is activated by default on this one. Deactivate it in the config file.)
