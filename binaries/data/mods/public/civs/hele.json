The Hellenic peoples of the Dorian, Ionian, and Aeolian tribes swept into modern day Greece from 3000 B.C. to around 1100 B.C. in successive waves that eventually supplanted the previously established cultures of Mycenae and Minoan Crete. They were most active during the period of colonization that took place in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C., the Greco-Persian Wars (499-449 B.C.), the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.), and the conquests of Alexander the Great (4th Century B.C.). Their civilization would endure until their final absorption by Rome in 146 B.C.",
