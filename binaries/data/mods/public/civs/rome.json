	"History": "The Romans controlled the largest empire of the ancient world. Rising from a group of villages to controlling an empire stretching from southern Scotland to the Sahara Desert, Rome remained one of the strongest nations on earth for almost 800 years. Initially Rome controlled Italy, but after three wars with Carthage began to expand in all directions. At its peak, Rome's empire contained over 60 million inhabitants, one quarter of the Earth's population at that time. But this massive empire soon became too large to control and barbarians began swarming into the Empire. The 300 years before the fall of Rome in 476 A.D. were mostly spent trying to keep the ever-increasing flood of migrant barbarians back behind the Rhine and Danube rivers.",

The Decumane gate is directly opposite to the Praetorian in the rear of the camp, and through this the soldiers are conducted to the place appointed for punishment or execution. It has a turf wall, and it's surrounded by a canal filled with water whenever possible for extra defence. Many towns started up as bigger military camps to evolve to more complicated cities.",
