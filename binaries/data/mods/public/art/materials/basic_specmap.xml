    <!-- REQUIRES: Actor must provide a texture named "specTex", where the RGB channels
		   provide a specular colour multiplier. 
		   Material must provide a uniform definition for "specularPower" that controls
		   the glossiness of the effect.
	 COMMENT: The intensity of the colour controls the specular amount, so black pixels have
		  no specularity. 
	 COMPATIBILITY: This effect is incompatible with the old "USE_SPECULAR" effect.
	 EFFICIENCY: This is a relatively inexpensive effect that should run easily on most hardware. -->

     First value: Normal mapping intensity.

	 Third value: Parallax scale.
	 Fourth value: AO amount. -->
