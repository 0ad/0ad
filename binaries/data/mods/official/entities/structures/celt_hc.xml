			history="Classical Historians gave account to gruesome sacrifices done in dark forest groves. Trees were of great importance to the Celts. The word Druid is closely related to the word for oak. The image of the Gaul’s temple will be a circular oak grove. The image of the Briton’s temple will be a stone megalith, or would that be too cliché?"
