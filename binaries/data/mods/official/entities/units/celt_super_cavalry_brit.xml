			<History>The Britons were one of the last European peoples to use two-horse chariots in combat. They had two iron-rimmed wheels and a flat riding platform that typically carried a driver and a warrior. Useless as shock weapons against tightly packed troops, they were useful for running down individual soldiers and as a stable mount to launch javelins from. The heads of defeated opponents often adorned the chassis to show the warrior’s prowess.</History>
