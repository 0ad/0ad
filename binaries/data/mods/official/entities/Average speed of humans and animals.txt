The average speed of a human without armor is 3 MPH walking and 10 MPH running
Horses walk an average speed of 5MPH and run an average of 30 MPH ...thoroughbreds can run an average of 37 MPH

I am going to test these ratios while keeping the consistent walking speed we have already in place so the animation doesn't look as though it is forward "moonwalking". I will also adjust the speeds depending on armor/weight.

Before any changes we seem to have running speeds only 2 times as fast as walking which is inacurate for realism. I will test this all out and see how it would affect gameplay.

UPDATE: I reduced the speed of the units so they are moving properly in relation to the buildings etc. The speed of units has a ton to do with the dynamics of the gameplay and realism of combat strategy so I feel that having it at a realistic ratio will benefit the gameplay and really make use of the charge/stamina idea. I love that idea btw.

I have all template human units set up with the realistic speed now, horses and all.


note:
I really wish we had a smooth transition between walk and run with a different acceleration variable for each unit type.
