[font="sans-bold-20"]You tried to start the game with incompatible or missing mods![/font]
[font="sans-16"]
Solve the compatibility issue by disabling invalid mods or enabling required dependencies. You can then save & start the game.

Incompatible mods will appear in red in the list of enabled mods (bottom panel). Dependencies can be added by enabling them in the upper panel.
