/**
 * Texture manager with asynchronous loading and automatic DDS conversion/compression.
 *
 * Input textures can be any format. They will be converted to DDS using settings defined
 * in files named "texture.xml", in the same directory as the texture and in its parent
 * directories. See CTextureConverter for the XML syntax. The DDS file will be cached
 * for faster loading in the future.
 *
 * Typically the graphics code will initialise many textures at the start of the game,
 * mostly for off-screen objects, by calling CreateTexture().
 * Loading texture data may be very slow (especially if it needs to be converted
 * to DDS), and we don't want the game to become unresponsive.
 * CreateTexture therefore returns an object immediately, without loading the
 * texture. If the object is never used then the data will never be loaded.
 *
 * Typically, the renderer will call CTexture::Bind() when it wants to use the
 * texture. This will trigger the loading of the texture data. If it can be loaded
 * quickly (i.e. there is already a cached DDS version), then it will be loaded before
 * the function returns, and the texture can be rendered as normal.
 *
 * If loading will take a long time, then Bind() binds a default placeholder texture
 * and starts loading the texture in the background. It will use the correct texture
 * when the renderer next calls Bind() after the load has finished.
 *
 * It is also possible to prefetch textures which are not being rendered yet, but
 * are expected to be rendered soon (e.g. for off-screen terrain tiles).
 * These will be loaded in the background, when there are no higher-priority textures
 * to load.
 *
 * The same texture file can be safely loaded multiple times with different GL parameters
 * (but this should be avoided whenever possible, as it wastes VRAM).
 *
 * For release packages, DDS files can be precached by appending ".dds" to their name,
 * which will be used instead of doing runtime conversion. This means most players should
 * never experience the slow asynchronous conversion behaviour.
 * These cache files will typically be packed into an archive for faster loading;
 * if no archive cache is available then the source file will be converted and stored
 * as a loose cache file on the user's disk.
