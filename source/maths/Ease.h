/**
 * Generic easing functions. In each function, the parameters are:
 * 
 * @param t Current time in seconds, as a float between 0 and d (inclusive).
 * @param d Total duration of the ease, in seconds. Must be strictly positive.
 * @param b Baseline value (at t = 0).
 * @param c Delta from baseline value to reach the target value (at t = d). I.e., target = b + c.
 * 
 * Each function outputs the eased value between 'b' and 'b+c' at time 't'.
