/**
 * Implements an interface providing fundamental capabilities required for reinforcement
 * learning (over HTTP).
 *
 * This consists of enabling an external script to configure the scenario (via Reset) and
 * then step the game engine manually and apply player actions (via Step). The interface
 * also supports querying unit templates to provide information about max health and other
 * potentially relevant game state information.
 *
 * See source/tools/rlclient/ for the external client code.
 *
 * The HTTP server is threaded.
 * Flow of data (with the interface active):
 *  0. The game/main thread calls TryApplyMessage()
 *    - If no messages are pending, GOTO 0 (the simulation is not advanced).
 *  1. TryApplyMessage locks m_MsgLock, pulls the message, processes it, advances the simulation, and sets m_GameState.
 *  2. TryApplyMessage notifies the RL thread that it can carry on and unlocks m_MsgLock. The main thread carries on frame rendering and goes back to 0.
 *  3. The RL thread locks m_MsgLock, reads m_GameState, unlocks m_MsgLock, and sends the gamestate as HTTP Response to the RL client.
 *	4. The client processes the response and ultimately sends a new HTTP message to the RL Interface.
 *  5. The RL thread locks m_MsgLock, pushes the message, and starts waiting on the game/main thread to notify it (step 2).
 *   - GOTO 0.
