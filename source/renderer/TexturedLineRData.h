/**
 * Rendering data for an STexturedOverlayLine.
 *
 * Note that instances may be shared amongst multiple copies of the same STexturedOverlayLine instance.
 * The reason is that this rendering data is non-copyable, but we do wish to maintain copyability of
 * SOverlayTexturedLineData to not limit its usage patterns too much (particularly the practice of storing
 * them into containers).
 *
 * For this reason, instead of storing a reverse pointer back to any single SOverlayTexturedLine, the methods
 * in this class accept references to STexturedOverlayLines to work with. It is up to client code to pass in
 * SOverlayTexturedLines to all methods that are consistently the same instance or non-modified copies of it.
