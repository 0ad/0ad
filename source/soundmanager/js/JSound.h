// JS sound binding

// interface rationale:
// - can't just expose fire and forget playSound to script code:
//   we sometimes need to loop until a certain condition is met
//   (e.g. building is complete) => need means of access (Handle) to sound.
//
// - the current 64-bit Handle can't be stored as-is by JS code;
//   we could make it 32 bit, but that limits its usefulness
//   (barely enough tag bits).
//
// - instead, we provide a thin class wrapper (using scriptableobject.h)
//   on top of the snd API that encapsulates the Handle.
