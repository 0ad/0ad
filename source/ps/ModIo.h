/**
 * mod.io API interfacing code.
 *
 * Overview
 *
 * This class interfaces with a remote API provider that returns a list of mod files.
 * These can then be downloaded after some cursory checking of well-formedness of the returned
 * metadata.
 * Downloaded files are checked for well formedness by validating that they fit the size and hash
 * indicated by the API, then we check if the file is actually signed by a trusted key, and only
 * if all of that is success the file is actually possible to be loaded as a mod.
 *
 * Security considerations
 *
 * This both distrusts the loaded JS mods, and the API as much as possible.
 * We do not want a malicious mod to use this to download arbitrary files, nor do we want the API
 * to make us download something we have not verified.
 * Therefore we only allow mods to download one of the mods returned by this class (using indices).
 *
 * This (mostly) necessitates parsing the API responses here, as opposed to in JS.
 * One could alternatively parse the responses in a locked down JS context, but that would require
 * storing that code in here, or making sure nobody can overwrite it. Also this would possibly make
 * some of the needed accesses for downloading and verifying files a bit more complicated.
 *
 * Everything downloaded from the API has its signature verified against our public key.
 * This is a requirement, as otherwise a compromise of the API would result in users installing
 * possibly malicious files.
 * So a compromised API can just serve old files that we signed, so in that case there would need
 * to be an issue in that old file that was missed.
 *
 * To limit the extend to how old those files could be the signing key should be rotated
 * regularly (e.g. every release). To allow old versions of the engine to still use the API
 * files can be signed by both the old and the new key for some amount of time, that however
 * only makes sense in case a mod is compatible with both engine versions.
 *
 * Note that this does not prevent all possible attacks a package manager/update system should
 * defend against. This is intentionally not an update system since proper package managers already
 * exist. However there is some possible overlap in attack vectors and these should be evalutated
 * whether they apply and to what extend we can fix that on our side (or how to get the API provider
 * to help us do so). For a list of some possible issues see:
 * https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md
 *
 * The mod.io settings are also locked down such that only mods that have been authorized by us
 * show up in API queries. This is both done so that all required information (dependencies)
 * are stored for the files, and that only mods that have been checked for being ok are actually
 * shown to users.
