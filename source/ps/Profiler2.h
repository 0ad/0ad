/**
 * @file
 * New profiler (complementing the older CProfileManager)
 *
 * The profiler is designed for analysing framerate fluctuations or glitches,
 * and temporal relationships between threads.
 * This contrasts with CProfilerManager and most external profiling tools,
 * which are designed more for measuring average throughput over a number of
 * frames.
 *
 * To view the profiler output, press F11 to enable the HTTP output mode
 * and then open source/tools/profiler2/profiler2.html in a web browser.
 *
 * There is a single global CProfiler2 instance (g_Profiler2),
 * providing the API used by the rest of the game.
 * The game can record the entry/exit timings of a region of code
 * using the PROFILE2 macro, and can record other events using
 * PROFILE2_EVENT.
 * Regions and events can be annotated with arbitrary string attributes,
 * specified with printf-style format strings, using PROFILE2_ATTR
 * (e.g. PROFILE2_ATTR("frame: %d", m_FrameNum) ).
 *
 * This is designed for relatively coarse-grained profiling, or for rare events.
 * Don't use it for regions that are typically less than ~0.1msecs, or that are
 * called hundreds of times per frame. (The old CProfilerManager is better
 * for that.)
 *
 * New threads must call g_Profiler2.RegisterCurrentThread before any other
 * profiler functions.
 *
 * The main thread should call g_Profiler2.RecordFrameStart at the start of
 * each frame.
 * Other threads should call g_Profiler2.RecordSyncMarker occasionally,
 * especially if it's been a long time since their last call to the profiler,
 * or if they've made thousands of calls since the last sync marker.
 *
 * The profiler is implemented with thread-local fixed-size ring buffers,
 * which store a sequence of variable-length items indicating the time
 * of the event and associated data (pointers to names, attribute strings, etc).
 * An HTTP server provides access to the data: when requested, it will make
 * a copy of a thread's buffer, then parse the items and return them in JSON
 * format. The profiler2.html requests and processes and visualises this data.
 *
 * The RecordSyncMarker calls are necessary to correct for time drift and to
 * let the buffer parser accurately detect the start of an item in the byte stream.
 *
 * This design aims to minimise the performance overhead of recording data,
 * and to simplify the visualisation of the data by doing it externally in an
 * environment with better UI tools (i.e. HTML) instead of within the game engine.
 *
 * The initial setup of g_Profiler2 must happen in the game's main thread.
 * RegisterCurrentThread and the Record functions may be called from any thread.
 * The HTTP server runs its own threads, which may call the ConstructJSON functions.
