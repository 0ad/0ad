This file is used by all bits of GUI code that need to repeat some code
for a variety of types (to avoid repeating the list of types in half a dozen
places, and to make it much easier to add a new type). Just do
		#define TYPE(T) your_code_involving_T;
		#include "gui/SettingTypes/GUISettingTypes.h"
		#undef TYPE
to handle every possible type.
