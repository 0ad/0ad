wxWidgets:
* alt+f with notebook tab focussed
* wxLogTrace "%s" wxGetMessage (msw/window.cpp)

==============================

Colour tester:

==============================

Actor editor:

* Fix new actor fields


==============================

General and/or unsorted miscellany:

* Regression testing

* Open actors from prop-actor selection

* Make import undo work with multi-control windows, and update the title bar

===

* Better input controls (=> export nicely, support undo, etc)

* Help (tooltips, etc)

* More efficient Datafile::ReadList (don't read from disk every time)

* Version number

* Better colouring in test_dude.xml, where some variants have no data

* Tab to move between fields

===

* Test/fix when running with large fonts, or weird XP styles

* Better copy and paste (e.g. between multiple instances of the program,
  and paste XML into other text-editing programs

* Save on exit: don't ask if no changes

* Browse for meshes/actors/etc, in a more nice/correct/unbuggy way

* Window size memory

* Column width memory

* Allow reset memory

* Input validation?

* Browse for meshes/actors/etc, with mods

* Customised AtObj->string conversion

* Undo in text-editing boxes

* AtlasObjectXML error handling

* Use standard wxWidgets 2.5.4 release

* Fix Escape in combo boxes inside dialogs

* Make wxFileHistory work when not at the very end of a menu

===

* Document lots

* wxListItemAttr* OnGetItemAttr(long item) >>>const<<< - wx documentation wrong?

* Better column widths / window sizes

* Don't create a row when editing a blank one then removing focus without typing anything

======

Done: (newest at top)

* Display DDS info (compression, size)
* Copy and paste
* 'Create entity' button (take name, parent)
* Correct undo menu entry when selecting 'New' (so it's not 'Import')
* MRU file list
* 'New' menu item
* Import/export filter, for validation(?) and for handling attributes
