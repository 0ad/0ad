introduction
------------

a resource is an instance of a specific type of game data (e.g. texture),
described by a control block (example fields: format, pointer to tex data).

this module allocates storage for the control blocks, which are accessed
via handle. it also provides support for transparently reloading resources
from disk (allows in-game editing of data), and caches resource data.
finally, it frees all resources at exit, preventing leaks.


handles
-------

handles are an indirection layer between client code and resources
(represented by their control blocks, which contains/points to its data).
they allow an important check not possible with a direct pointer:
guaranteeing the handle references a given resource /instance/.

problem: code C1 allocates a resource, and receives a pointer p to its
control block. C1 passes p on to C2, and later frees it.
now other code allocates a resource, and happens to reuse the free slot
pointed to by p (also possible if simply allocating from the heap).
when C2 accesses p, the pointer is valid, but we cannot tell that
it is referring to a resource that had already been freed. big trouble.

solution: each allocation receives a unique tag (a global counter that
is large enough to never overflow). Handles include this tag, as well
as a reference (array index) to the control block, which isn't directly
accessible. when dereferencing the handle, we check if the handle's tag
matches the copy stored in the control block. this protects against stale
handle reuse, double-free, and accidentally referencing other resources.

type: each handle has an associated type. these must be checked to prevent
using textures as sounds, for example. with the manual vtbl scheme,
this type is actually a pointer to the resource object's vtbl, and is
set up via H_TYPE_DEFINE. this means that types are private to the module
that declared the handle; knowledge of the type ensures the caller
actually declared, and owns the resource.


guide to defining and using resources
-------------------------------------

1) choose a name for the resource, used to represent all resources
of this type. we will call ours "Res1"; all below occurrences of this
must be replaced with the actual name (exact spelling).
why? the vtbl builder defines its functions as e.g. Res1_reload;
your actual definition must match.

2) declare its control block:
struct Res1
{
	void* data;		// data loaded from file
	size_t flags;		// set when resource is created
};

Note that all control blocks are stored in fixed-size slots
(HDATA_USER_SIZE bytes), so squeezing the size of your data doesn't
help unless yours is the largest.

3) build its vtbl:
H_TYPE_DEFINE(Res1);

this defines the symbol H_Res1, which is used whenever the handle
manager needs its type. it is only accessible to this module
(file scope). note that it is actually a pointer to the vtbl.
this must come before uses of H_Res1, and after the CB definition;
there are no restrictions WRT functions, because the macro
forward-declares what it needs.

4) implement all 'virtual' functions from the resource interface.
note that inheritance isn't really possible with this approach -
all functions must be defined, even if not needed.

--

init:
one-time init of the control block. called from h_alloc.
precondition: control block is initialized to 0.

static void Type_init(Res1* r, va_list args)
{
	r->flags = va_arg(args, int);
}

if the caller of h_alloc passed additional args, they are available
in args. if init references more args than were passed, big trouble.
however, this is a bug in your code, and cannot be triggered
maliciously. only your code knows the resource type, and it is the
only call site of h_alloc.
there is no provision for indicating failure. if one-time init fails
(rare, but one example might be failure to allocate memory that is
for the lifetime of the resource, instead of in reload), it will
have to set the control block state such that reload will fail.

--

reload:
does all initialization of the resource that requires its source file.
called after init; also after dtor every time the file is reloaded.

static Status Type_reload(Res1* r, const VfsPath& pathname, Handle);
{
	// already loaded; done
	if(r->data)
		return 0;

	r->data = malloc(100);
	if(!r->data)
		WARN_RETURN(ERR::NO_MEM);
	// (read contents of <pathname> into r->data)
	return 0;
}

reload must abort if the control block data indicates the resource
has already been loaded! example: if texture's reload is called first,
it loads itself from file (triggering file.reload); afterwards,
file.reload will be called again. we can't avoid this, because the
handle manager doesn't know anything about dependencies
(here, texture -> file).
return value: 0 if successful (includes 'already loaded'),
negative error code otherwise. if this fails, the resource is freed
(=> dtor is called!).

note that any subsequent changes to the resource state must be
stored in the control block and 'replayed' when reloading.
example: when uploading a texture, store the upload parameters
(filter, internal format); when reloading, upload again accordingly.

--

dtor:
frees all data allocated by init and reload. called after reload has
indicated failure, before reloading a resource, after h_free,
or at exit (if the resource is still extant).
except when reloading, the control block will be zeroed afterwards.

static void Type_dtor(Res1* r);
{
	free(r->data);
}

again no provision for reporting errors - there's no one to act on it
if called at exit. you can ENSURE or log the error, though.

be careful to correctly handle the different cases in which this routine
can be called! some flags should persist across reloads (e.g. choices made
during resource init time that must remain valid), while everything else
*should be zeroed manually* (to behave correctly when reloading).
be advised that this interface may change; a "prepare for reload" method
or "compact/free extraneous resources" may be added.

--

validate:
makes sure the resource control block is in a valid state. returns 0 if
all is well, or a negative error code.
called automatically when the Handle is dereferenced or freed.

static Status Type_validate(const Res1* r);
{
	const int permissible_flags = 0x01;
	if(debug_IsPointerBogus(r->data))
		WARN_RETURN(ERR::_1);
	if(r->flags & ~permissible_flags)
		WARN_RETURN(ERR::_2);
	return 0;
}


5) provide your layer on top of the handle manager:
Handle res1_load(const VfsPath& pathname, int my_flags)
{
	// passes my_flags to init
	return h_alloc(H_Res1, pathname, 0, my_flags);
}

Status res1_free(Handle& h)
{
	// control block is automatically zeroed after this.
	return h_free(h, H_Res1);
}

(this layer allows a res_load interface on top of all the loaders,
and is necessary because your module is the only one that knows H_Res1).

6) done. the resource will be freed at exit (if not done already).

here's how to access the control block, given a <Handle h>:
a)
	H_DEREF(h, Res1, r);

creates a variable r of type Res1*, which points to the control block
of the resource referenced by h. returns "invalid handle"
(a negative error code) on failure.
b)
	Res1* r = h_user_data(h, H_Res1);
	if(!r)
		; // bail

useful if H_DEREF's error return (of type signed integer) isn't
acceptable. otherwise, prefer a) - this is pretty clunky, and
we could switch H_DEREF to throwing an exception on error.
