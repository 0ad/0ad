/**
 * VFS path of the form "(dir/)*file?"
 *
 * in other words: the root directory is "" and paths are separated by '/'.
 * a trailing slash is allowed for directory names.
 * rationale: it is important to avoid a leading slash because that might be
 * confused with an absolute POSIX path.
 *
 * there is no restriction on path length; when dimensioning character
 * arrays, prefer PATH_MAX.
