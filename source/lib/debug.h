// this module provides platform-independent debug facilities, useful for
// diagnosing and reporting program errors.
// - a symbol engine provides access to compiler-generated debug information and
//   can also give a stack trace including local variables;
// - our more powerful assert() replacement gives a stack trace so
//   that the underlying problem becomes apparent;
// - the output routines make for platform-independent logging and
//   crashlogs with "last-known activity" reporting.

 * "added" via debug_filter_add is the appendant string displayed.
 *
 * this approach is easiest to implement and is fine because we control
 * all logging code. LIMODS falls from consideration since it's not
 * portable and too complex.
 *
 * notes:
 * - filter changes only affect subsequent debug_*printf calls;
 *   output that didn't pass the filter is permanently discarded.
 * - strings not starting with a tag are always displayed.
