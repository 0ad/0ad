/**
 * (header-less) pool-based heap allocator
 * provides Allocate and Deallocate without requiring in-band headers;
 * this is useful when allocating page-aligned I/O buffers
 * (headers would waste an entire page per buffer)
 *
 * policy:
 * - allocation: first exhaust the freelist, then allocate more
 * - freelist: address-ordered good fit, always split blocks
 * - coalescing: immediate
 * mechanism:
 * - coalescing: boundary tags in freed memory with distinct bit patterns
 * - freelist: segregated range lists of power-of-two size classes
 *
 * note: this module basically implements a (rather complex) freelist and
 * could be made independent of the Pool allocation scheme. however, reading
 * neighboring boundary tags may cause segmentation violations; knowing the
 * bounds of valid committed memory (i.e. Pool extents) avoids this.
