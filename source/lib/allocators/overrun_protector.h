/**
OverrunProtector wraps an arbitrary object in isolated page(s) and
can detect inadvertent writes to it. this is useful for
tracking down memory overruns.

the basic idea is to require users to request access to the object and
notify us when done; memory access permission is temporarily granted.
(similar in principle to Software Transaction Memory).

since this is quite slow, the protection is disabled unless
CONFIG2_ALLOCATORS_OVERRUN_PROTECTION == 1; this avoids having to remove the
wrapper code in release builds and re-write when looking for overruns.

example usage:
OverrunProtector\<T\> wrapper;
..
T* p = wrapper.get();   // unlock, make ready for use
if(!p)                  // wrapper's one-time alloc of a T-
	abort();            // instance had failed - can't continue.
DoSomethingWith(p);     // (read/write access)
wrapper.lock();         // disallow further access until next .get()
..
