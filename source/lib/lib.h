/**

low-level aka "lib"
-------------------

this codebase was grown from modules shared between several projects,
i.e. my personal library; hence the name "lib". it has been expanded to
fit the needs of 0ad - in particular, resource loading.

owing to the dual-use situation, the 0ad coding conventions are not met;
also, major changes are ill-advised because they may break other projects.


design goals
------------

- fast and low-overhead, including startup time
- portable: must run on Win32, Mac OS X and Linux
- reusable across projects, i.e. no dependency on a
  central 'manager' that ties modules together.


scope
-----

- POSIX definitions
- resource management
- debugging tools (including memory tracker)
- low-level helper functions, e.g. ADTs, endian conversion and timing
- platform-dependent system/feature detection
