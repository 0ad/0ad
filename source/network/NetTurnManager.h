/*
 * This file deals with the logic of the network turn system. The basic idea is as in
 * http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3094/1500_archers_on_a_288_network_.php?print=1
 *
 * Each player performs the simulation for turn N.
 * User input is translated into commands scheduled for execution in turn N+2 which are
 * distributed to all other clients.
 * After a while, a player wants to perform the simulation for turn N+1,
 * which first requires that it has all the other clients' commands for turn N+1.
 * In that case, it does the simulation and tells all the other clients (via the server)
 * it has finished sending commands for turn N+2, and it starts sending commands for turn N+3.
 *
 * Commands are redistributed immediately by the server.
 * To ensure a consistent execution of commands, they are each associated with a
 * client session ID (which is globally unique and consistent), which is used to sort them.
