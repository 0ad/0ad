    /**
     * @brief This is a manager for server-less messaging (@xep{0174}).
     *
     * Enable compilation of this code with the @c \-\-enable-mdns switch to @c configure, or add
     * @c \#define @c HAVE_MDNS to your platform's @c config.h. @c dns_sd.h, @c libdns_sd.so, as well
     * as the @c mdnsd daemon from Apple's bonjour distribution are required. The @c mdnsd daemon has
     * to be running on the local host.
     *
     * ### Browsing the local network for XMPP services
     *
     * You can use the Manager to browse the local network for XMPP services.
     * First, create a new instance, register a LinkLocal::Handler, and call startBrowsing().
     * @code
     * m_mdns = new LinkLocal::Manager( ... );
     * m_mdns->registerLinkLocalHandler( yourHandler );
     * m_mdns->startBrowsing();
     * @endcode
     *
     * Then you will need to call @c recv() periodcally. The handler will then receive lists of available
     * or removed services. Check the @c flag member of the Service struct.
     *
     * @code
     * void MyClass::handleBrowseReply( const Service& service )
     * {
     *   LinkLocal::ServiceList::const_iterator it = services.begin();
     *   for( ; it != services.end(); ++it )
     *   {
     *     if( (*it).flag == LinkLocal::AddService )
     *     {
     *       // new service
     *     }
     *     else
     *     {
     *       // service removed
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * @note Note that your own service may show up in the list, too.
     *
     * ### Connecting to an XMPP service
     *
     * Using the info from the Service struct you can initiate a connection to the remote entity.
     * First, create a new instance of LinkLocal::Client and register some basic handlers like you
     * would with a normal gloox::Client:
     *
     * @code
     * LinkLocal::Client c( JID( "romeo@montague.net" ) );
     * c.logInstance().registerLogHandler( LogLevelDebug, LogAreaAll, this ); // optional
     * c.registerConnectionListener( yourConnectionListener );
     * @endcode
     *
     * Then call @link gloox::LinkLocal::Client::connect( const std::string&, const std::string&, const std::string&, int ) connect() @endlink
     * and pass the paramters from the Service struct that you received in handleBrowseReply().
     *
     * @code
     * c.connect( "juliet@laptop", "_presence._tcp", ".local", 4 ); // don't use literal values
     * @endcode
     *
     * Put your LinkLocal::Client instance in your event loop (or in a separate thread) and call
     * @link gloox::LinkLocal::Client::recv() recv() @endlink periodically.
     *
     * ### Advertising an XMPP service on the local network
     *
     * To advertise your own XMPP service you can (re-)use the same Manager instance from 'browsing the local network'
     * above.
     *
     * You can publish some basic info about your service in a DNS TXT record. The Manager offers the addTXTData() function
     * for that. See http://xmpp.org/registrar/linklocal.html for a list of official parameters.
     *
     * @code
     * m_mdns->addTXTData("nick","July");
     * m_mdns->addTXTData("1st","Juliet");
     * m_mdns->addTXTData("last","Capulet");
     * m_mdns->addTXTData("msg","Hanging out");
     * m_mdns->addTXTData("jid","julia@capulet.com");
     * m_mdns->addTXTData("status","avail");
     * @endcode
     *
     * Then, to start publishing the availability of your service as well as the TXT record with the additional info
     * you just call @c registerService().
     *
     * @code
     * m_mdns->registerService();
     * @endcode
     *
     * Other entities on the network will now be informed about the availability of your service.
     *
     * ### Listening for incoming connections
     *
     * The second argument to Manager's constructor is a ConnectionHandler-derived class that
     * will receive incoming connections.
     *
     * When registerService() gets called, the Manager will also start a local server that will
     * accept incoming connections. By default, it will listen on port 5562.
     *
     * In @link gloox::ConnectionHandler::handleIncomingConnection() handleIncomingConnection() @endlink
     * you should create a new LinkLocal::Client and register some basic handlers:
     *
     * @code
     * LinkLocal::Client c( JID( "romeo@desktop" ) );
     * c.logInstance().registerLogHandler( LogLevelDebug, LogAreaAll, this );
     * c.registerMessageHandler( this );
     * c.registerConnectionListener( this );
     * @endcode
     *
     * Finally you have to attach the incoming connection to the Client instance, and call connect().
     *
     * @code
     * connection->registerConnectionDataHandler( &c );
     * c.setConnectionImpl( connection );
     * c.connect();
     * @endcode
     *
     * Add the Client to your event loop to call recv() periodically.
     *
     * @see @c linklocal_example.cpp in @c src/examples/ for a (very) simple implementation of a bot
     * handling both incoming and outgoing connections.
     *
