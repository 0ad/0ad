  /**
   * @brief This class implements a basic Jabber/XMPP Client.
   *
   * It supports @ref sasl_auth as well as TLS (Encryption), which can be
   * switched on/off separately. They are used automatically if the server supports them.
   *
   * To use, create a new Client instance and feed it connection credentials, either in the Constructor or
   * afterwards using the setters. You should then register packet handlers implementing the corresponding
   * Interfaces (ConnectionListener, PresenceHandler, MessageHandler, IqHandler, SubscriptionHandler),
   * and call @ref connect() to establish the connection to the server.
   *
   * @note While the MessageHandler interface is still available (and will be in future versions)
   * it is now recommended to use the new @link gloox::MessageSession MessageSession @endlink for any
   * serious messaging.
   *
   * Simple usage example:
   * @code
   * using namespace gloox;
   *
   * void TestProg::doIt()
   * {
   *   Client* j = new Client( "user@server/resource", "password" );
   *   j->registerPresenceHandler( this );
   *   j->disco()->setVersion( "TestProg", "1.0" );
   *   j->disco()->setIdentity( "client", "bot" );
   *   j->connect();
   * }
   *
   * virtual void TestProg::presenceHandler( Presence* presence )
   * {
   *   // handle incoming presence packets here
   * }
   * @endcode
   *
   * However, you can skip the presence handling stuff if you make use of the RosterManager.
   *
   * By default, the library handles a few (incoming) IQ namespaces on the application's behalf. These
   * include:
   * @li jabber:iq:roster: by default the server-side roster is fetched and handled. Use
   * @ref rosterManager() and @ref RosterManager to interact with the Roster.
   * @li @xep{0092} (Software Version): If no version is specified, a name of "based on gloox" with
   * gloox's current version is announced.
   * @li @xep{0030} (Service Discovery): All supported/available services are announced. No items are
   * returned.
   * @note As of gloox 0.9, by default a priority of 0 is sent along with the initial presence.
   * @note As of gloox 0.9, initial presence is automatically sent. Presence: available, Priority: 0.
   * To disable sending of initial Presence use setPresence() with a value of Unavailable
   * prior to connecting.
   *
   * @section sasl_auth SASL Authentication
   *
   * Besides the simple, IQ-based authentication (@xep{0078}), gloox supports several SASL (Simple
   * Authentication and Security Layer, RFC 2222) authentication mechanisms.
   * @li DIGEST-MD5: This mechanism is preferred over all other mechanisms if username and password are
   * provided to the Client instance. It is secure even without TLS encryption.
   * @li PLAIN: This mechanism is used if DIGEST-MD5 is not available. It is @b not secure without
   * encryption.
   * @li ANONYMOUS This mechanism is used if neither username nor password are set. The server generates
   * random, temporary username and resource and may restrict available services.
   * @li EXTERNAL This mechanism is currently only available if client certificate and private key
   * are provided. The server tries to figure out who the client is by external means -- for instance,
   * using the provided certificate or even the IP address. (The restriction to certificate/key
   * availability is likely to be lifted in the future.)
   *
   * Of course, all these mechanisms are not tried unless the server offers them.
   *
   * @section stream_management Stream Management
   *
   * To enable Stream Management (@xep{0198}), call @ref setStreamManagement() with the first parameter set to @b true
   * at any time. This will tell the server to enable Stream Management, if the feature is available. Once switched on,
   * Stream Management can not be disabled for a given active stream. However, setting the first
   * parameter to @b false, it can be disabled inside gloox so that Stream Management will not be used
   * for subsequent connections.
   *
   * To enable the stream resumption feature, pass @b true as the second parameter to @ref setStreamManagement().
   * Upon re-connect after an unexpected (i.e. neither user-triggered nor server-triggered) disconnect, gloox will try
   * to resume the stream and re-send any non-acknowledged stanzas automatically.
   * For stream resumption to work you have to re-connect using the very same Client instance.
   *
   * After an unexpected disconnect you may check the send queue using @link ClientBase::sendQueue() sendQueue() @endlink.
   * Stanzas in the queue have been sent but not yet acknowledged by the server. Depending on the circumstances of the
   * disconnect, this does not mean that those stanzas have not been received by the recipient.
   *
