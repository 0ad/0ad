   * @brief This class adds Chat State Notifications (@xep{0085}) support to a MessageSession.
   *
   * This implementation of Chat States is fully transparent to the user of the class.
   * If the remote entity does not request chat states, ChatStateFilter will not send
   * any, even if the user requests it. (This is required by the protocol specification.)
   * You MUST annouce this capability by use of Disco (associated namespace is XMLNS_CHAT_STATES).
   * (This is also required by the protocol specification.)
   *
   * @note You must register ChatState as a StanzaExtension by calling
   * ClientBase::registerStanzaExtension() for notifications to work.
