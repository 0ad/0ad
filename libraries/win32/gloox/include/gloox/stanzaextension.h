  /**
   * @brief This class abstracts a stanza extension, which is usually
   * an XML child element in a specific namespace inside an XMPP stanza.
   *
   * This class is the base class for almost all protocol extensions in gloox.
   * As such, it should be used whenever an add-on to the core XMPP spec
   * needs to be made. For simple protocols it may suffice to create a sub-class
   * of StanzaExtension. For protocols which require keeping of state, an additional
   * persistent object acting like a manager may be needed.
   *
   * A Stanza can be extended by additional namespaced child elements. Obviously,
   * it is not viable to include all the kinds of extensions possible. To avoid
   * hard-coding of such extensions into gloox, StanzaExtension can be used to
   * inform the core of gloox about additional supported extensions without it
   * needing to know about the exact implementation.
   *
   * Note that a StanzaExtension can be used for both sending and receiving
   * of custom protocols. When receiving, gloox requires an appropriate implementation
   * of the pure virtuals filterString() and newInstance(). To be able to properly use
   * the encapsulation, some getters may be necessary. Note that the object you will be
   * dealing with usually is @em const.
   *
   * For sending StanzaExtensions, a custom constructor (as well as some setters,
   * possibly) is needed. Additionally, an implementation of tag() is required.
   *
   * @li Sub-class StanzaExtension and add at least a constructor that accepots a Tag*
   * (so it can parse an incoming extension in XML format), as well as one accepting
   * whatever data you need to construct outgoing extension XML. Alternatively to the latter
   * (or in addition) you can also add setters, of course. One of the constructors should
   * be able to create an empty instance so it can be passed to ClientBase when registering
   * your extension type. This empty instance will only be used to create another new instance
   * using the Tag* constructor when matching extension XML comes in.
   *
   * @li Re-implement filterString(). filterString()
   * is supposed to return an XPath expression that matches the child element
   * of a stanza that the protocol-to-implement uses. For example, consider this
   * hypothetical XML format: The protocol is encapsulated inside a &lt;stats&gt;
   * element in the 'ext:stats' namespace. It uses IQ stanzas for transmission.
   * @code
   * <iq from='...' to='...' id='id1' type='get'>
   *   <stats xmlns='ext:stats'/>
   * </iq>
   *
   * <iq from='...' to='...' id='id1' type='result'>
   *   <stats xmlns='ext:stats'>
   *     <users>10</users>
   *   </stats>
   * </iq>
   * @endcode
   * The idea of filterString() and its XPath expression is to match the
   * &lt;stats&gt; element such that it can be fed to your
   * StanzaExtension-derived class' constructor when creating a new instance
   * of it. For our @e stats protocol, filterString() would return something like:
   * <em>/iq/stats[\@xmlns='ext:stats']</em>
   *
   * @li When subclassing StanzaExtension, you have to initialize it with an int, the extension's
   * type. You should choose a value that is not yet used in gloox, and unique to
   * the given extension you implement. In general, you are free to use values
   * above @link gloox::ExtUser ExtUser @endlink, e.g ExtUser+1, etc. See
   * @link gloox::StanzaExtensionType StanzaExtensionType @endlink for existing values.
   *
   * @li The next step is to implement newInstance(). Whenever filterString()'s
   * XPath expression matches a child element of an incoming stanza, newInstance()
   * is called with the matched Tag. For our example above, this is the &lt;stats&gt;
   * element (including its children):
   * @code
   * <stats xmlns='ext:stats'>
   *   <users>10</users>
   * </stats>
   * @endcode
   * The purpose of newInstance() is to return a new instance of your specialized
   * StanzaExtension (implicitly cast to StanzaExtension). This way, gloox can deal
   * entirely with the abstract base, StanzaExtension, and never ever needs to know
   * which kind of extension it deals with. The most common implementation of
   * newInstance() looks like this:
   * @code
   * StanzaExtension* StatsExtension::newInstance( const Tag* tag ) const
   * {
   *   return new StatsExtension( tag );
   * }
   * @endcode
   * This of course implies that a constructor exists that takes a <em>const Tag*</em> as the
   * only parameter.
   *
   * @li Finally, gloox must be able to serialize the StanzaExtension back
   * into string'ified XML. This is done by means of the tag() function which
   * must be reimplemented. The output Tag should -- like the input Tag -- be embeddable
   * into the respective stanza.
   *
   * @li To actually use this you have to register your new extension with
   * ClientBase::registerStanzaExtension(). Here, an empty instance of your class should be
   * passed, which will act as a template later (by means of StanzaExtension::clone(), which
   * you should reimplement).
   *
   * @li You can now also register your handlers with ClientBase,
   * by using the exttype you used in your subclasses with @link ClientBase::registerIqHandler() registerIqHandler() @endlink,
   * @link ClientBase::registerMessageHandler() registerMessageHandler() @endlink,
   * @link ClientBase::registerPresenceHandler() registerPresenceHandler() @endlink, or
   * @link ClientBase::registerSubscriptionHandler() registerSubscriptionHandler() @endlink.
   * ClientBase will then check incoming stanzas against your filter string(s) and call the respective handlers.
