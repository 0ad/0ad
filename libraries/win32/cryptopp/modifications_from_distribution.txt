steps taken:
- download distribution
- use .sln and VC8 to compile all projects in Debug and Release configuration
- move Win32/output/cryptest.exe to /
- run "cryptest v", make sure it says "all tests passed" at the end
- move libs in Win32/dll_output to lib/ ; rename the debug one cryptoppd.lib
- move all headers to include/cryptest
- delete Win32/, in which only output files remain
- move all files and directories except this one, include and lib into source_and_build_and_test_files/
- zip that directory
