 * the XML 1.0 specification), or is used for formal declaration of
 * Processing Instruction targets (see section 2.6 of the XML 1.0
 * specification). The <code>nodeName</code> attribute inherited from
 * <code>DOMNode</code> is set to the declared name of the notation.
 * <p>The DOM Level 1 does not support editing <code>DOMNotation</code> nodes;
