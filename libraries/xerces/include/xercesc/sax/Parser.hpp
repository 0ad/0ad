  * Basic interface for SAX (Simple API for XML) parsers.
  *
  * All SAX parsers must implement this basic interface: it allows
  * applications to register handlers for different types of events
  * and to initiate a parse from a URI, or a character stream.
  *
  * All SAX parsers must also implement a zero-argument constructor
  * (though other constructors are also allowed).
  *
  * SAX parsers are reusable but not re-entrant: the application
  * may reuse a parser object (possibly with a different input source)
  * once the first parse has completed successfully, but it may not
  * invoke the parse() methods recursively within a parse.
