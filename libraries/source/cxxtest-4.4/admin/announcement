We are pleased to announce the updated release of CxxTest 4.4.  CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit. CxxTest is easy to use because it does not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a very flexible form of test discovery.

This release includes a variety of bug fixes:

 - Fixed compilation error on Windows (MSVC) in XmlFormatter.h (#86)
 - Fix to ensure that tearDown() is called (#89)
 - Add option run test with a user defined command in scons (#91)
 - Use a Python path relative to the cxxtestgen script (#88)
 - Add defensive guard in ErrorFormatter.h (#96)
 - Fixed bug with "None" appearing in CXXTEST_CPPATH (#99)
 - Added CXXTEST_LIBPATH to properly use shared libraries (#100)
 - Added guards when XmlFormatter.h data is not initialize (#87)

See the CxxTest Home Page (http://cxxtest.com) for documentation and download instructions.

Enjoy!
