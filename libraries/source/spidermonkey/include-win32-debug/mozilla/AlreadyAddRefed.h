 * already_AddRefed cooperates with reference counting smart pointers to enable

 * this as a return type from a function that returns an already |AddRef|ed
 * pointer.
 *
 * TODO Move already_AddRefed to namespace mozilla.  This has not yet been done
 * because of the sheer number of usages of already_AddRefed.
 *
 * When should you use already_AddRefed<>?
 * * Ensure a consumer takes ownership of a reference
 * * Pass ownership without calling AddRef/Release (sometimes required in
 *   off-main-thread code)
 * * The ref pointer type you're using doesn't support move construction
 *
 * Otherwise, use Move(RefPtr/nsCOMPtr/etc).

   * We want to allow returning nullptr from functions returning
   * already_AddRefed<T>, for simplicity.  But we also don't want to allow
   * returning raw T*, instead preferring creation of already_AddRefed<T> from
   * a reference counting smart pointer.
   *
   * We address the latter requirement by making the (T*) constructor explicit.
   * But |return nullptr| won't consider an explicit constructor, so we need
   * another constructor to handle it.  Plain old (decltype(nullptr)) doesn't
   * cut it, because if nullptr is emulated as __null (with type int or long),
   * passing nullptr to an int/long parameter triggers compiler warnings.  We
   * need a type that no one can pass accidentally; a pointer-to-member-function
   * (where no such function exists) does the trick nicely.
   *
   * That handles the return-value case.  What about for locals, argument types,
   * and so on?  |already_AddRefed<T>(nullptr)| considers both overloads (and
   * the (already_AddRefed<T>&&) overload as well!), so there's an ambiguity.
   * We can target true nullptr using decltype(nullptr), but we can't target
   * emulated nullptr the same way, because passing __null to an int/long
   * parameter triggers compiler warnings.  So just give up on this, and provide
   * this behavior through the default constructor.
   *
   * We can revert to simply explicit (T*) and implicit (decltype(nullptr)) when
   * nullptr no longer needs to be emulated to support the ancient b2g compiler.
   * (The () overload could also be removed, if desired, if we changed callers.)

  // WARNING: sketchiness ahead.
  //
  // The x86-64 ABI for Unix-like operating systems requires structures to be
  // returned via invisible reference if they are non-trivial for the purposes
  // of calls according to the C++ ABI[1].  For our consideration here, that
  // means that if we have a non-trivial move constructor or destructor,
  // already_AddRefed must be returned by invisible reference.  But
  // already_AddRefed is small enough and so commonly used that it would be
  // beneficial to return it via registers instead.  So we need to figure out
  // a way to make the move constructor and the destructor trivial.
  //
  // Our destructor is normally non-trivial, because it asserts that the
  // stored pointer has been taken by somebody else prior to destruction.
  // However, since the assert in question is compiled only for DEBUG builds,
  // we can make the destructor trivial in non-DEBUG builds by simply defining
  // it with `= default`.
  //
  // We now have to make the move constructor trivial as well.  It is normally
  // non-trivial, because the incoming object has its pointer null-ed during
  // the move. This null-ing is done to satisfy the assert in the destructor.
  // But since that destructor has no assert in non-DEBUG builds, the clearing
  // is unnecessary in such builds; all we really need to perform is a copy of
  // the pointer from the incoming object.  So we can let the compiler define
  // a trivial move constructor for us, and already_AddRefed can now be
  // returned in registers rather than needing to allocate a stack slot for
  // an invisible reference.
  //
  // The above considerations apply to Unix-like operating systems only; the
  // conditions for the same optimization to apply on x86-64 Windows are much
  // more strigent and are basically impossible for already_AddRefed to
  // satisfy[2].  But we do get some benefit from this optimization on Windows
  // because we removed the nulling of the pointer during the move, so that's
  // a codesize win.
