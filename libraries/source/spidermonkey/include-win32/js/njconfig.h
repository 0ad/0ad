     * A struct used to configure the assumptions that Assembler can make when
     * generating code. The ctor will fill in all fields with the most reasonable
     * values it can derive from compiler flags and/or runtime detection, but
     * the embedder is free to override any or all of them as it sees fit.
     * Using the ctor-provided default setup is guaranteed to provide a safe
     * runtime environment (though perhaps suboptimal in some cases), so an embedder
     * should replace these values with great care.
     *
     * Note that although many fields are used on only specific architecture(s),
     * this struct is deliberately declared without ifdef's for them, so (say) ARM-specific
     * fields are declared everywhere. This reduces build dependencies (so that this
     * files does not require nanojit.h to be included beforehand) and also reduces
     * clutter in this file; the extra storage space required is trivial since most
     * fields are single bits.
